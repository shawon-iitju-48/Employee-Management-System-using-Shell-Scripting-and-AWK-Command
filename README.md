# Overview
Employee Management System is a basic demonstration of shell scripting implementation with
additional database handling using awk commands. This project deals with adding, modifying ,
searching, deleting data from database and also performing different queries using awk command
to extract desired data from the database. In this project the practical learning of Operating System
Lab course is reflected.

# Objectives
The main objectives of doing this project are-
* know how to build a real life management system using shell scripting
* knowing more about **AWK** command and how it is used to manipulate a set of
records(database)
* knowing about file manipulation in shell scripting
* knowing about sed command in shell scripting
<br><br />
# About AWK Command
### Why we use AWK?
AWK is a domain specific language designed for text processing and
typically used as a data extraction and reporting tool. It is used for manipulating text files which
are divided into records or lines, and each line is divided into fields.
It doesn't require that every line have the same format. But if a file is more structured like
spreadsheet or a database, then we can do many things with it.
### AWK Operations:
* Find interesting records in a data file.
* Print or save specific fields.
* Perform manipulations like swapping the order of fields or combining them into one field.
* Sophisticated data operations like join.
